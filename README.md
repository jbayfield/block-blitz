# Block Blitz

![Build](https://github.com/jbayfield/block-blitz/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

This is a game inspired by the popular Breakout game, released by Atari in 1976.

It's purely an exercise in playing with the 32blit SDK, Pimoroni Picosystem and C++ in general.
Code will be ugly, things won't make sense, but it's all in the name of fun and learning. If somebody has fun as a result, that's a bonus. :)
